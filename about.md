I live in Brno, Czech republic. I'm 27 year old guy who graduated from [FIT
BUT][fit-but] (master's degree programme information security technology).  I
worked at AVG (now Avast!), currently I work at Red Hat in a team
[AICoE][aicoe] which stands for Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence.
Besides my studies in IT, I studied psychology and pedagogy.

[My bachelor theses at FIT BUT](bc-theses) was written for AVG. Its full name
is Reconstruction of Instruction idioms in a [retargetable decompiler][retdec],
supervised by [Jakub Kroustek][jk-twitter]. I published few articles about it
in magazines such as [ComSIS][ComSIS] or [IEEE][IEEE].  The theses was awarded
with 3rd place in a university theses competition. I continued with my theses
and I focused mostly on de-optimizations of assemblies/C code in the decompiler
which were handled by a separate LLVM module written in C++. As the decompiler
was later open-sourced, you can check it in its [repo][retdec-src].

After my bachelor studies, I took master's classes and spent 6 months as an
Erasmus student on Crete where I met awesome people from all around the world.
Right after my arrival to Brno, I finished my theses and graduated in
psychology and pedagogy with the final theses titled "Anxiety and
Meticulousness" (I passed with honors). I'm still interested in psychology; I
took certifications targeted on soft-skills, people management, business
skills, etc.

During my master's, I started to work for Red Hat where I enrolled my [master's
theses "Linux VPN performance and optimization"](ing-theses), which was
supervised (from RH side) by [Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos][nikos], the author of
Gnu TLS.  The main goal of the theses was to reduce number of context switches
that were needed in OpenConnect VPN for each packet. The final result of my
theses is a Linux kernel module [AF_KTLS][ktls] introducing TLS/DTLS type
socket, which was adopted by Facebook and later Facebook made it to the Linux
kernel mainline [starting Linux
4.13](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15164568).  My final place in study
branch class was in TOP 3 students.

My main interest in IT are algorithmic puzzles, C/C++ (I like assemblies, but I
don't like to write huge asm sources), Python and lately machine learning
algorithms. I used to maintain Go projects in Fedora; during the maintenance, I
helped with [gofed](https://github.com/gofed) and developed a distributed tool
[gofed-ng][gofed-ng]. After that, I moved to another project at Red Hat where I
developed [Selinon][selinon] that was used for big data processing in
[openshift.io](https://openshift.io) introduced at [Red Hat summit
2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtTnnw3DakY&t=30m33s).

Now I work in a team titled [AICoE][aicoe] that is a part of Red Hat's Office
of the CTO. In this team, we are applying machine learning in various areas.
Most of the time I work on a project called [Thoth][thoth]. Project Thoth is a
recommendation system which is targeting machine learning application stacks
and recommends you to use libraries based on various attributes such as
performance or reliability. You can find more information about project [Thoth
on GitHub][thoth-station] and [Thoth page][thoth-page]. I tend to engage also
in other projects within Red Hat such as optimized TensorFlow builds which you
can find on our [experimental Python package index][index-aicoe].

Besides IT, I like nature (I love sunset), good books ([Man's Search for
Meaning is my favourite][frankl]), football (I used to be a goalkeeper), guitar
music (occasionally I play guitar) and a good beer. I hate shoddy or
disrespectful people. I also hate traffic jams as they drive me crazy.

My pseudonym is often fridex if you haven't noticed yet (yes, poisonous
ethylene glycol). I am occasional public blogger, so don't expect me to write
posts on daily basis. I would like to try spreading my thoughts via
[Medium][medium], maybe I [tweet][twitter] more often. If you are a Red Hatter,
you can find some blogs at Red Hat's internal blog system.

If you would like to reach out to me, just let me know ðŸ˜‰.
